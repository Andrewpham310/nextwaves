# ðŸ¤– NextWaves Chatbot Setup Guide

## Environment Variables Setup

To enable the chatbot with AI capabilities, you need to set up environment variables:

### 1. Create `.env` file in your project root

Create a `.env` file in `d:\code\nextwaves\nextwaves\` with the following content:

```env
# Chatbot API Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_CHATBOT_ENABLED=true

# Optional: Other API keys for future features
# VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_email_service_key
# VITE_APPOINTMENT_API_KEY=your_appointment_service_key
```

### 2. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` in your `.env` file

### 3. Restart Development Server

After creating the `.env` file:

```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```
